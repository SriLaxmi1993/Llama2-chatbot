🦙💬 Llama 2 Chat
This chatbot is created using the open-source Llama 2 LLM model from Meta.

Particularly, we're using the Llama2-7B model deployed by the Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) team and hosted on the Replicate platform.

This app was refactored from a16z's implementation of their LLaMA2 Chatbot to be light-weight for deployment to the Streamlit Community Cloud.
